# CQL Interpreter

This project consists of developing an interpreter for the **CQL (Comma Query Language)**, a query language inspired by SQL designed to operate on CSV files. The interpreter is implemented in Python using the [PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/) library.
> **Academic Context**  
> This application was developed as part of the ‚ÄúLanguage Processing‚Äù course in the second year of the degree in Computer Systems Engineering (Licenciatura em Engenharia de Sistemas Inform√°ticos) at Instituto Polit√©cnico do C√°vado e do Ave.

## üìö Description

The main goal is to allow users to perform data query and manipulation operations on CSV files using SQL-like commands. The features include:

- **Table import and export**: `IMPORT TABLE`, `EXPORT TABLE`
- **Queries**: `SELECT` with support for `WHERE` and `LIMIT` clauses
- **Table manipulation**: `CREATE TABLE`, `RENAME TABLE`, `DISCARD TABLE`
- **Procedures**: defining and executing procedures with `PROCEDURE` and `CALL`
- **Comments**: support for single-line and multi-line comments

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/)
- [PLY (Python Lex-Yacc)](https://www.dabeaz.com/ply/)
